# CHANGELOG -  v.1.4.1-beta
After a playtest session with a potential player, I have implemented a few of the feedbacks I received and improved on the issues found.
I have also reintroduced the block pull mechanic but it still isn't optimal. It might be refined later but at this point I need to urgently starting more testing so I'll just release it as is.

## **Changed:**
- Tweaks to the Stages so they either become uncheesable or a bit less troublesome.
- Made the Tips more descriptive.
- Black Ground Harmony is now slower. Still a bit faster than complementary.
- Ajustments to each individual Parallax layer speed

## **Added:**
- ((Grabbing mechanic. Reprogrammed from scratch.))
- Introduction to Color Theory Screen
- Game time slowdown while Chromatic Circle is open.

## **Fixed:**
- Fixed scaling issues with the backgrounds on main screen and level select.
- Fixed bug where Wall Jump capability would not be immediately updated while hanging onto a wall
